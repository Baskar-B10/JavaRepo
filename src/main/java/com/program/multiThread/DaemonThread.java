package com.program.multiThread;// Java program to demonstrate the usage of
// setDaemon() and isDaemon() method.
//In Java, daemon threads are low-priority threads that run in the background
// to perform tasks such as garbage collection or provide services to user threads.
// The life of a daemon thread depends on the mercy of user threads, meaning that when
// all user threads finish their execution, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
// automatically terminates the daemon thread.
//
//To put it simply, daemon threads serve user threads by handling background tasks
// and have no role other than supporting the main execution.
//
//Example of Daemon Thread in Java
//
//Some examples of daemon threads in Java include garbage collection (gc) and finalizer.
// These threads work silently in the background, performing tasks that support the
// main execution without interfering with the userâ€™s operations.
