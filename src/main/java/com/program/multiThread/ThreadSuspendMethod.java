		//The suspend() method of thread class puts the thread from running to
		// waiting state. This method is employed
		// if you would like to prevent the thread execution and begin
		// it again when a particular event occurs. This method allows a
		// thread to temporarily cease execution. The suspended thread is often
		// resumed using the resume() method. If the present thread cannot modify
		// the target thread then itâ€™ll throw Security Exception.
		//
		//Note: suspend() method is deprecated in the latest Java version.
		//Note: Thread t2 can be resumed by resume() method.
		
		// call run() method 
		t3.start();
